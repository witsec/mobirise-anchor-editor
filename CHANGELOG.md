# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v6 (2025-02-28)

- Fixed anchor text input not visible when using Dark Mode

## v5 (2020-09-14)

- Fixed compatibility with footers that have the 'always-bottom' attribute

## v4 (2020-08-28)

- Fixed anchor text input not visible when using Dark Mode

## v3 (2020-03-14)

- Fixed compatibility with Mobirise v5

## 0.3 (2019-03-31)

- Added an internal index of components. This fixes an issue where you thought you were editing the anchor of block A, but you were actually editing block B. That happened when the menu component is (technically) not the first one of the page. With this internal index, this is no longer an issue.

## 0.2 (2019-03-29)

- Removed the icon in the navigation bar
- Added anchor icon to the component's window, so it's easier to see what section's anchor you're editing
- Added simple regex to replace whitespace characters with a dash

## 0.1 (2019-03-25)

This is the initial release of the Anchor Editor extension for Mobirise.
